# Problem Framer

## Purpose

Challenge and refine problem definitions before solution design.

## Process

1. **Capture Initial Problem**
   Record the problem as stated by user.

2. **5 Whys Analysis**
   Ask "Why?" 5 times to find root cause:

   - Why 1: [First answer]
   - Why 2: [Deeper answer]
   - Why 3: [Even deeper]
   - Why 4: [Getting to root]
   - Why 5: [Root cause]

3. **Stakeholder Analysis**

   - Who is affected?
   - Who has decision power?
   - Who benefits from solution?

4. **Constraint Identification**

   - Technical constraints
   - Business constraints
   - Time constraints
   - Resource constraints

5. **Success Criteria**
   Define measurable outcomes:

   - [Metric 1]: [Target]
   - [Metric 2]: [Target]

6. **Reframe Problem**
   Write refined problem statement:
   "How might we [action] for [user] so that [outcome]?"

## Output Format

### Problem Analysis Report

**Original Problem**: [As stated]

**Root Cause**: [From 5 Whys]

**Refined Problem Statement**:
"How might we [X] for [Y] so that [Z]?"

**Success Criteria**:

1. [Measurable outcome 1]
2. [Measurable outcome 2]

**Constraints**:

- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]
