# API Architect — Full Lifecycle API Development

Design, build, test, document, secure, and monitor production-grade APIs. Not just curl commands — a complete engineering methodology.

## When to Use

- Designing a new API (REST, GraphQL, or gRPC)
- Reviewing an existing API for quality, consistency, or security
- Generating or validating OpenAPI/Swagger specs
- Building comprehensive test suites (unit, integration, contract, load)
- Debugging production API issues
- Planning API versioning and deprecation
- Setting up monitoring, rate limiting, and error handling

---

## Phase 1: API Design

### Design-First Approach

Always design before coding. The spec IS the contract.

#### Resource Modeling

Map your domain to resources using this template:

```yaml
# api-design.yaml
service: order-management
base_path: /api/v1
resources:
  - name: orders
    path: /orders
    description: Customer purchase orders
    identifier: order_id (UUID)
    parent: null
    operations: [list, create, get, update, cancel]
    sub_resources:
      - name: line_items
        path: /orders/{order_id}/items
        operations: [list, add, update, remove]
      - name: payments
        path: /orders/{order_id}/payments
        operations: [list, create, get, refund]
    states: [draft, confirmed, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled]
    transitions:
      - from: draft → to: confirmed (action: confirm)
      - from: confirmed → to: processing (action: process)
      - from: processing → to: shipped (action: ship)
      - from: shipped → to: delivered (action: deliver)
      - from: [draft, confirmed] → to: cancelled (action: cancel)
```

#### Naming Conventions Checklist

| Rule | Good | Bad |
|---|---|---|
| Design public routes around **capabilities (use-cases)**, not DB tables | `POST /order-now` | `POST /orders` (catch-all “create order”) |
| Use **POST for commands** (side effects), **GET for reads** | `POST /orders/{id}/cancel` | `GET /orders/{id}/cancel` |
| Prefer **verbs on a known noun** for follow-up actions | `POST /orders/{id}/refund` | `POST /refund-order`, `POST /doRefund` |
| Use **stable resources/views for reads**, even if writes are command-based | `GET /orders/{id}` | `GET /order-now/result` |
| Keep **one endpoint per distinct use-case** when inputs/behavior differ | `POST /order-now`, `POST /subscribe-monthly` | `POST /orders` with a giant “type” switch |
| Avoid action words like `get`, `set`, `do` in paths | `GET /orders/{id}` | `GET /getOrder`, `POST /doCheckout` |
| Use **nouns for read collections**, not verbs | `GET /orders?status=pending` | `GET /listOrders`, `GET /searchOrders` |
| Use **plural nouns** for collections | `GET /orders` | `GET /order`, `GET /orderList` |
| Put **identifiers in the path**, not the body/query for single-resource ops | `GET /orders/o_123` | `GET /orders?id=o_123` |
| Model **long-running work as jobs** | `POST /reports/{id}/run` → `202` + `GET /jobs/{jobId}` | `POST /reports/{id}/run` that hangs for 90s |
| Make command endpoints **idempotent when money/state is involved** | `POST /order-now` + `Idempotency-Key: ...` | `POST /order-now` with no retry safety |
| Use **consistent action naming** (verb in imperative, same vocabulary) | `POST /subscriptions/{id}/pause` | `POST /subscriptions/{id}/stopIt`, `POST /subscriptions/{id}/freeze` |
| Don’t leak internal model terms; use **domain language** | `POST /payouts/{id}/release` | `POST /ledgerEntries/{id}/commit` |
| Return **links to next steps** (discoverability) | `{ "links": { "order": "/orders/o_123", "cancel": "/orders/o_123/cancel" } }` | “Here’s an id, good luck” |
| Keep paths **shallow**; avoid deep nesting beyond the aggregate | `/orders/{id}/items` | `/users/{u}/accounts/{a}/orders/{o}/items/{i}` |
| Use **HTTP status codes** to reflect outcomes (201/202/409/422) | `201 Created`, `202 Accepted`, `422` | Always `200 OK` with `{ "ok": false }` |
| Version the API **once at the top** (if needed) | `/v1/order-now` | `/order-now/v1`, `/v1/orders/v2/create` |


#### HTTP Methods — Decision Matrix

```
Need to...                          → Method   Idempotent?  Safe?
Get a resource or collection        → GET      Yes          Yes
Create a new resource               → POST     No           No
Full replace of a resource          → POST     Yes          No
Partial update of a resource        → POST     No*          No
Remove a resource                   → DELETE   Yes          No
Check if resource exists            → HEAD     Yes          Yes
List allowed methods                → OPTIONS  Yes          Yes

```

#### Status Code Decision Tree

```
Success?
├── Created something new? → 201 Created (Location header)
├── Accepted for async processing? → 202 Accepted (include status URL)
├── No body to return? → 204 No Content
└── Returning data? → 200 OK

Client error?
├── Malformed request syntax? → 400 Bad Request
├── No/invalid credentials? → 401 Unauthorized
├── Valid credentials but insufficient permissions? → 403 Forbidden
├── Resource doesn't exist? → 404 Not Found
├── Method not allowed on resource? → 405 Method Not Allowed
├── Conflict with current state? → 409 Conflict
├── Resource permanently gone? → 410 Gone
├── Validation failed? → 422 Unprocessable Entity
├── Too many requests? → 429 Too Many Requests (Retry-After header)
└── Precondition failed (etag mismatch)? → 412 Precondition Failed

Server error?
├── Unexpected failure? → 500 Internal Server Error
├── Upstream dependency failed? → 502 Bad Gateway
├── Temporarily overloaded? → 503 Service Unavailable (Retry-After)
└── Upstream timeout? → 504 Gateway Timeout
```

### Request/Response Design

#### Standard Response Envelope

```json
// Success (single resource)
{
  "data": { "id": "ord_abc123", "status": "confirmed", ... },
  "meta": { "request_id": "req_xyz789" }
}

// Success (collection)
{
  "data": [ ... ],
  "meta": { "request_id": "req_xyz789" },
  "pagination": {
    "total": 142,
    "page": 2,
    "per_page": 20,
    "total_pages": 8,
    "next": "/api/v1/orders?page=3&per_page=20",
    "prev": "/api/v1/orders?page=1&per_page=20"
  }
}

// Error
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED",
    "message": "Request validation failed",
    "details": [
      { "field": "email", "message": "Must be a valid email address", "code": "INVALID_FORMAT" },
      { "field": "age", "message": "Must be at least 18", "code": "MIN_VALUE", "min": 18 }
    ]
  },
  "meta": { "request_id": "req_xyz789" }
}
```

#### Pagination Patterns — When to Use Which

| Pattern | Use When | Pros | Cons |
|---------|----------|------|------|
| **Offset** `?page=2&per_page=20` | Simple UI pagination, small datasets | Easy to implement, page jumping | Drift on inserts, slow on large offsets |
| **Cursor** `?after=eyJ...&limit=20` | Infinite scroll, real-time feeds, large datasets | Consistent, performant | No page jumping, opaque cursors |
| **Keyset** `?created_after=2024-01-01&limit=20` | Time-series data, logs | Fast, transparent | Requires sortable field, no count |

#### Filtering, Sorting, Field Selection

```
# Filtering
GET /orders?status=active&created_after=2024-01-01&total_min=100

# Sorting (prefix - for descending)
GET /orders?sort=-created_at,total

# Field selection (reduce payload)
GET /orders?fields=id,status,total,customer.name

# Search
GET /products?q=wireless+headphones

# Combined
GET /orders?status=active&sort=-created_at&fields=id,status,total&page=1&per_page=10
```

## Phase 2: OpenAPI Specification

### Generate OpenAPI 3.1 Spec

For each resource in your design, generate a complete spec:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0

| 10 | Enums used for fixed value sets | /2 |

**Score: ___/20** (Target: 16+)

---

## Phase 3: Implementation Patterns

### Request Validation Layer

Every endpoint MUST validate before processing:

```
Validation Order:
1. Content-Type header (reject non-JSON early)
2. Authentication (401 before wasting cycles)
3. Authorization (403 - does this user have access?)
4. Path parameters (404 - does the resource exist?)
5. Query parameters (400 - valid types/ranges?)
6. Request body schema (422 - valid structure?)
7. Business rules (422 - valid state transition?)
```

### Error Handling — Standard Error Codes

Define a consistent error code enum for your API:

```
# Authentication & Authorization
AUTH_REQUIRED          — No credentials provided
AUTH_INVALID           — Invalid/expired credentials
AUTH_INSUFFICIENT      — Valid credentials, wrong permissions
AUTH_RATE_LIMITED       — Too many auth attempts

# Validation
VALIDATION_FAILED      — Generic validation error (see details array)
INVALID_FORMAT         — Field format wrong (email, UUID, etc.)
REQUIRED_FIELD         — Required field missing
OUT_OF_RANGE           — Value outside allowed range
INVALID_ENUM           — Value not in allowed set

# Resource
NOT_FOUND              — Resource doesn't exist
ALREADY_EXISTS         — Duplicate (unique constraint)
CONFLICT               — State conflict (e.g., already cancelled)
GONE                   — Resource permanently deleted

# Business Logic
INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS     — Payment-related
QUOTA_EXCEEDED         — Usage limit reached
FEATURE_DISABLED       — Feature flag off
DEPENDENCY_FAILED      — Upstream service error

# System
INTERNAL_ERROR         — Unexpected server error
SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE    — Temporarily down
TIMEOUT                — Request took too long
```

### Idempotency

For non-idempotent operations (POST), require an idempotency key:

```
Request:
POST /orders
Idempotency-Key: ord_req_abc123

Server behavior:
1. Check if Idempotency-Key was seen before
2. If yes → return cached response (same status, same body)
3. If no → process request, cache response for 24h
4. Key format: client-generated UUID or meaningful string
```

### Rate Limiting

Standard headers to include:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100          # Max requests per window
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 67       # Remaining in current window
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1706886400   # Unix timestamp when window resets
Retry-After: 30                 # Seconds to wait (on 429)
```

Rate limit tiers:

| Tier | Limit | Window | Use Case |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| Standard | 100/min | Sliding | Normal API calls |
| Bulk | 10/min | Sliding | Batch operations |
| Search | 30/min | Sliding | Full-text search |
| Auth | 5/min | Fixed | Login attempts |
| Webhook | 1000/min | Sliding | Incoming webhooks |

---

## Phase 4: Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid for APIs

```
        /  E2E  \          — 5-10 critical user flows
       / Contract \        — Schema validation, backward compat
      / Integration \      — Database, external services, auth
     /    Unit Tests  \    — Business logic, validation, transforms
    ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
```

### Test Checklist Per Endpoint

For EVERY endpoint, only test the happy path end to end.

## Phase 5: Security

### Security Checklist (audit every API)

```yaml
authentication:
  - [ ] All endpoints require auth (except /health, /docs, public webhooks)
  - [ ] Tokens expire (short-lived access + long-lived refresh)
  - [ ] Token rotation supported
  - [ ] Failed auth returns 401 with no info leakage
  - [ ] API keys are hashed in storage (never plain text)

authorization:
  - [ ] Resource-level checks (user can only access their data)
  - [ ] Endpoint-level checks (role-based access)
  - [ ] No IDOR vulnerabilities (can't guess other users' resource IDs)
  - [ ] Admin endpoints separately protected
  - [ ] Webhook endpoints verify signatures

input_validation:
  - [ ] All inputs validated server-side (never trust client)
  - [ ] SQL injection prevented (parameterized queries only)
  - [ ] NoSQL injection prevented
  - [ ] Path traversal prevented
  - [ ] Request size limited (body, headers, URL length)
  - [ ] File upload types restricted and scanned

output_security:
  - [ ] No sensitive data in responses (passwords, tokens, internal IDs)
  - [ ] No stack traces in production errors
  - [ ] Consistent error format (no info leakage in different error types)
  - [ ] PII redacted in logs

transport:
  - [ ] HTTPS only (HTTP redirects to HTTPS)
  - [ ] HSTS header set
  - [ ] TLS 1.2+ required
  - [ ] CORS configured restrictively (specific origins, not *)
  
headers:
  - [ ] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - [ ] X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - [ ] Content-Security-Policy set
  - [ ] No Server version header
  - [ ] Cache-Control: no-store for sensitive endpoints
```

### CORS Configuration

```yaml
# Restrictive (recommended)
cors:
  origins:
    - https://app.example.com
    - https://admin.example.com
  methods: [GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE]
  headers: [Authorization, Content-Type, X-Request-ID]
  credentials: true
  max_age: 3600

# Common mistakes to avoid:
# ❌ Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *  (with credentials)
# ❌ Reflecting Origin header without validation
# ❌ Allowing all methods/headers
```

---

## Phase 6: Versioning & Deprecation

### Versioning Strategy Decision

| Strategy | Example | Pros | Cons | Use When |
|----------|---------|------|------|----------|
| **URL path** | `/v1/orders` | Explicit, easy routing | URL pollution | Public APIs, multiple major versions |
| **Header** | `API-Version: 2024-01` | Clean URLs | Hidden, harder to test | Internal APIs |
| **Query param** | `?version=2` | Easy to test | Pollutes params | Quick prototypes |
| **Date-based** | `2024-01-15` | Clear timeline | Many versions | Stripe-style APIs |

**Recommended**: URL path for major versions, header for minor variations.

### Deprecation Playbook

```
Timeline:
1. T+0: Announce deprecation (docs, changelog, email)
2. T+0: Add Deprecation + Sunset headers to old endpoints
3. T+30d: Log warnings for old endpoint usage
4. T+60d: Email heavy users of old endpoint directly
5. T+90d: Return 299 warning header
6. T+180d: Shut down old endpoint (410 Gone)

Headers:
Deprecation: true
Sunset: Sat, 01 Jun 2025 00:00:00 GMT
Link: <https://api.example.com/v2/orders>; rel="successor-version"
```

### Migration Guide Template

```markdown
# Migrating from v1 to v2

## Breaking Changes
1. `user.name` split into `user.first_name` + `user.last_name`
2. Pagination changed from offset to cursor-based
3. Error format updated (see new schema)

## Step-by-Step Migration
1. Update your client SDK to v2 (`npm install @example/sdk@2`)
2. Update response parsing for split name fields
3. Replace `?page=N` with `?after=cursor` pagination
4. Update error handling for new error format

## Compatibility Mode
Set `X-Compat-Mode: v1` header to get v1-style responses from v2 endpoints.
Available until 2025-06-01.
```

---

## Phase 7: Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics Dashboard

```yaml
availability:
  - Uptime percentage (target: 99.9% = 8.7h downtime/year)
  - Health check status (/health endpoint)
  - Error rate (5xx / total requests)

performance:
  - p50 latency (target: < 100ms)
  - p95 latency (target: < 500ms)
  - p99 latency (target: < 1000ms)
  - Throughput (requests/second)
  - Time to first byte (TTFB)

business:
  - Requests per endpoint (usage patterns)
  - Unique API consumers/day
  - Error rate by endpoint
  - Rate limit hits/day
  - Authentication failures/day

infrastructure:
  - Database query time (p95)
  - Connection pool utilization
  - Memory/CPU per instance
  - Queue depth (async operations)
```

### Structured Logging

Every request should log:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "level": "info",
  "request_id": "req_abc123",
  "method": "POST",
  "path": "/api/v1/orders",
  "status": 201,
  "duration_ms": 45,
  "user_id": "usr_xyz",
  "ip": "203.0.113.1",
  "user_agent": "MyApp/2.0",
  "request_size": 256,
  "response_size": 1024
}
```

### Health Check Endpoint

```json

## Phase 8: API Review Scoring

When reviewing an existing API, score across these dimensions:

### API Quality Rubric (0-100)

| Dimension | Weight | Criteria | Score |
|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Design Consistency** | 20% | Naming conventions, HTTP methods, status codes, URL structure | /20 |
| **Documentation** | 15% | OpenAPI spec, examples, error docs, changelog | /15 |
| **Error Handling** | 15% | Consistent format, helpful messages, proper codes, no leakage | /15 |
| **Security** | 20% | Auth, input validation, CORS, headers, no IDOR | /20 |
| **Performance** | 15% | Latency targets met, pagination, caching headers, N+1 prevented | /15 |
| **Developer Experience** | 15% | SDK quality, sandbox available, onboarding time, rate limit clarity | /15 |

**Score: ___/100**

| Rating | Score | Action |
|--------|-------|--------|
| 🟢 Excellent | 85-100 | Minor improvements only |
| 🟡 Good | 70-84 | Address gaps before next major release |
| 🟠 Needs Work | 50-69 | Prioritize improvements, create tech debt tickets |
| 🔴 Critical | <50 | Stop feature work, fix fundamentals first |

## GraphQL-Specific Guidance

### Schema Design Principles

```graphql
# Good: clear types, nullable where appropriate, connections for lists
type Order {
  id: ID!
  status: OrderStatus!
  customer: Customer!
  items(first: Int, after: String): ItemConnection!
  total: Money!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}

type Money {
  amount: Int!       # cents, not dollars (avoid float)
  currency: Currency!
}

enum OrderStatus {
  DRAFT
  CONFIRMED
  PROCESSING
  SHIPPED
  DELIVERED
  CANCELLED
}

# Mutations return the modified resource + errors
type CreateOrderPayload {
  order: Order
  errors: [UserError!]!
}

type UserError {
  field: [String!]
  message: String!
  code: ErrorCode!
}
```

### GraphQL Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| No depth limit | Query bombs | Limit depth to 5-7 levels |
| No complexity limit | Expensive queries | Assign cost per field, cap at 1000 |
| N+1 queries | Performance death | Use DataLoader pattern |
| No persisted queries | Security risk | Whitelist queries in production |
| Exposing internal IDs | Leaks implementation | Use opaque global IDs |
| No pagination | Memory explosion | Use Relay Connection spec |

## Edge Cases & Gotchas

### Timezone Handling
- Always store and return UTC (ISO 8601: `2024-01-15T10:30:00Z`)
- Accept timezone in input, convert to UTC immediately
- Never use local server time

### Large Payloads
- Set `Content-Length` limits (e.g., 1MB default, 10MB for uploads)
- Use streaming for file uploads (multipart/form-data)
- Compress responses (Accept-Encoding: gzip)
- For very large exports → return 202 + poll status endpoint

### Eventual Consistency
- If using async processing, always return 202 + status URL
- Include estimated completion time when possible
- Client should poll with exponential backoff

### Concurrent Updates
- Use ETags for optimistic concurrency:
  - GET returns `ETag: "v1"` header
  - PUT/PATCH sends `If-Match: "v1"` header
  - Server returns 412 if resource changed since

### Webhook Design
- Include event type, timestamp, and full resource in payload
- Sign payloads (HMAC-SHA256)
- Expect retries (make handlers idempotent)
- Return 200 quickly, process async
- Include webhook ID for deduplication
